# RoboticsProgrammingLaboratory
This repository holds the code developed during the Robotics Programming Laboratory class I took in FALL 2015 semester at ETH. 

Please consider that the whole code was developed in a hackaton-style class in a team of 2 people.

The quality of this work is not as high as it was planned due to the fast pace of the class.

An in-depth analysis of the tasks of the class can be found at this link

# Folder structure
1. Object recognition: 
Here you can finde C++ code for the object recognition node developed for assignment 3.

2. Localization
Here you can find C++ code for the localization (Particle Filter) node developed for the last assignment

3. roboscoop/thymio_app
Here some files were developed in EiffelStudio for Path planning and motion control of the Thymio robot. It should be noted that no prior knowledge of EiffelStudio was present at the beginning of the class.

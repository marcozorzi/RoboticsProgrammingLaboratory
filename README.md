# RoboticsProgrammingLaboratory
This repository holds the code developed during the Robotics Programming Laboratory class I took in FALL 2015 semester at ETH. 

Please consider that the whole code was developed in a hackaton-style class in a team of 2 people.

The quality of this work is not as high as it was planned due to the fast pace of the class.
